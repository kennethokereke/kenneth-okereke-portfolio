Try to navigate there using Uber.”\n                    <br /><br />\n                    I usertested 5 people and here is what they did:<br />\n                    - Only 1 person was able to find the current way to do this<br />\n                    - 4 out of the 5 people's first instict was to tap on the map<br />\n                    - Those 4 people's second instict was to dig through the menu system.\n                  </p>\n                  <div className=\"row\" id=\"dragDown\">\n                    <div className=\"col\">\n                      <h4 className=\"galleryHeader\">Discoverability</h4>\n                      <p>\n                        Going into this redesign I was under the impression that you couldn’t uber to a point on the map.

I created a bunch of low fidelity mocks and analyzed the pros and cons of each. These were the designs that stood out:</p>\n               </div>\n               <div className=\"horizGallery\">\n                  {/* <SRLWrapper>\n                    <img src={option1} />\n                    <img src={option2} />\n                    <img src={option3} />\n                    <img src={option4} />\n                 </SRLWrapper> */}\n               </div>\n               <div className=\"sectionContent\">\n                  <div className=\"row\">\n                    <div className=\"col\">\n                      <p>I ended up picking option 3 for a couple reasons. The main reason was that it was able to hide all the elements that didnt serve a purpose when you are scrolling around the map. It kept the question of “Where to?” on the screen and it kept the advertising card while hiding everything else.</p>\n                      <h4 className=\"galleryHeader\">Step 3: High-Fidelity Mockups</h4>\n                      <p>The next step was just to recreate the Uber app in sketch.

Finally, I went through all our projects assets and fixed violations of these guidelines across all of Jupyter's products.\n                  </p>\n                  {/* <object data={brandGuide} type=\"application/pdf\" width=\"100%\" height=\"460px\" internalinstanceid=\"3\" title=\"\">\n                      <p id=\"none\"></p>\n                  </object> */}\n               </div>\n             </div>\n             <div className=\"section\">\n               <div className=\"sectionContent\">\n                  <h2>Navbar</h2>\n                  <h4>The Project</h4>\n                  <p> Redesign the navbar to the project's website at <a href=\"www.jupyter.org\">www.jupyter.org</a> </p>\n                  <h4>Our Process</h4>\n                  <ol>\n                    <li> Gather info from Google Analytics  to learn what pages were important and which ones were getting ignored</li>\n                    <li> Talk to community  to understand which pages were important to them</li>\n                    <li> Organize data  and  create options  in excel</li>\n                    <li> Pick 3 favorite options </li>\n                    <li> Create high-fidelity prototypes  using sketch and invision</li>\n                    <li> Usertest  favorite options</li>\n                    <li> Refine  design</li>\n                    <li> Usertest  new design</li>\n                    <li> Implement  design</li>\n                  </ol>\n                  <div id=\"navbarImg\">\n                    {/* <img src={navbars} /> */}\n                  </div>\n               </div>\n             </div>\n            </div>\n         </div>\n      );\n   }\n}\n\nexport default Sweepr;\n\n","/Users/kennethokereke/Documents/kennethportfolio/src/Component/FilterBar.js",["81","82"],"import React from 'react';\n\nclass FilterBar extends React.Component {\n   render(props) {\n      return (\n         <div id=\"filterBar\">\n            <div className={(this.props.currFilter == \"Work\") ?

Traditionally eBay has not had a cohesive\n                   design language. Our team was responsible for creating a fully\n                   components-based design system and, in the process, a fresh new design\n                   language. I created 2 different patterns for this team: Empty States\n                   and Filtering for mobile devices.\n                 </p>\n                 <h2>Filtering on Mobile Devices</h2>\n                 <p>\n                   With this project I had to create a pattern for filtering a list of\n                   items/results on mobile devices. I needed to create logic and\n                   consistency across all our different pages. After that it was up to me\n                   to decide what to prioritize and what to change.\n                 </p>\n                 <h4>Step 1A: Internal Research</h4>\n                 <div id=\"lightbulbBanner\">\n                   <img src={lightBulb}/>\n                   <p>\n                     For me, understanding the current state of your own product is the\n                     most important step to designing a pattern that scales across every\n                     situation where your pattern may be used.\n                   </p>\n                 </div>\n                 <p>\n                   I spent a little over a week combing through both of ebay’s mobile\n                   apps and the mobile website, collecting screenshots, and talking to\n                   designers in every design team that I could think of that may get\n                   effected/benefit from my work on the filtering pattern. I came out of\n                   the internal research with 2 goals: <b>increase consistency</b> and\n                   <b>filter usage</b>.\n                 </p>\n                 <h4>Step 1B: External Research</h4>\n                 <p>\n                   The next thing I did was analyze what other companies were doing with\n                   their mobile filtering UIs. My goal here was to understand what\n                   scenarios their filter patterns were used in, which tradeoffs they\n                   made, and why they made those tradeoffs. Basically, I wanted to figure\n                   out every option that I might need to consider in my own designs.\n                   <br />\n                   <br />I gathered screenshots from 20 different company’s mobile apps\n                   and mobile websites and analyzed their filtering mechanisms in browse\n                   pages and search pages. It took me 3-4 days to go through over 350\n                   screenshots and distill down my thoughts into a couple different\n                   findings. I presented my research to a couple different stakeholders\n                   using the slide deck below:\n                 </p>\n                 <a\n                   id=\"dlButton\"\n                   href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1XJZuMjVv4DdViZdE-ye7nTdZLT1YTYIO6qy0q1ZyRFA/edit?usp=sharing\"\n                   target=\"_blank\"\n                 >\n                   View Research Presentation\n                   <img src={rightArrow} />\n                 </a>\n                 <h4>Step 2: Design Exploration</h4>\n                 <p>\n                   This step is where creativity comes in (methodical creativity). My\n                   goal here is to make sure that I’ve considered every possible option\n                   that makes any sort of sense.\n                   <br />\n                   <br />\n                   First I weighed the pros and cons of every type of filtering UI that I\n                   saw in my external research and tried to understand how they would\n                   affect our 2 main goals. I decided that a{\" \"}\n                   <b>pill-based filtering UI</b>\n                   {\"{\"}\" \"{\"}\"}\n                   would be the way to go.\n                 </p>\n                 <div id=\"proconChart\">\n                   <h4>A pill filtering system would:</h4>\n                   <div>\n                     <p>Find a filter you already have in mind</p>\n                     <img src={mehIcon} />\n                   </div>\n                   <div>\n                     <p>Discover what you should filter by</p>\n                     <img src={goodIcon} />\n                   </div>\n                   <div>\n                     <p>Remove filters you have applied</p>\n                     <img src={goodIcon} />\n                   </div>\n                   <div>\n                     <p>Edit filters you have applied</p>\n                     <img src={goodIcon} />\n                   </div>\n                   <div>\n                     <p>Dont add visual clutter &amp; distract from listings</p>\n                     <img src={badIcon} />\n                   </div>\n                 </div>\n                 <p>\n                   From there I broke down the pill filtering into specific design parts:\n                   placement, secondary buttons, highlighted filters, bottom overlay\n                   content style, and bottom overlay pill bar style. For each category I\n                   tried to come up with as many options as I could.\n                 </p>\n                 <h4>Step 3: Consolidation and Communication</h4>\n                 <p>\n                   Now I distilled all my wild options, into a few of the best options\n                   for each part of the UI. I tried to compile a list of pros and cons\n                   for each of these options and get really specific with my analysis.\n                   After getting feedback from my team and tweaking my analysis, I again\n                   went around to designers from different stakeholder teams across eBay\n                   to get their opinion on things. This is the point where I made it a\n                   point to get a lot of feedback from the accessibilty team and\n                   developers on feasability and engineering constraints.\n                 </p>\n                 <h4>Step 4: Interaction Design and Visual Details</h4>\n                 <p>\n                   The last step before wrapping my pattern up was to iron out the little\n                   details. With this pattern I really wanted to make sure the iteraction\n                   of opening up the bottom container made sense and felt natural. I also\n                   made it a point to finalize all the colors and icons.\n                 </p>\n               </div>\n             </div>\n             <div className=\"section\" id=\"finalSSF\">\n               <div className=\"sectionContent\">\n                 <div className=\"row\">\n                   <div className=\"col\" id=\"final\">\n                     <h4>The Final Product</h4>\n                     <p>\n                       At the end of this internship I provided sketch assets for every\n                       part of this pattern that other designers could use and detailed\n                       documentation on when and how to use this pattern.\n                     </p>\n                   </div>\n                   <div className=\"col\">\n                     {/* <video\n                       id=\"ebayPrototype\"\n                       className=\"video\"\n                       autoPlay\n                       loop\n                       playsInline\n                       muted\n                     >\n                       <source src={fullProto} type=\"video/mp4\" />\n                       Your browser does not support videos :(\n                     </video> */}\n                   </div>\n                 </div>\n               </div>\n             </div>\n             <div className=\"section\" id=\"ebayFooter\" />\n           </div>\n         </div>\n      );\n   }\n}\n\nexport default Johnson;\n","/Users/kennethokereke/Documents/kennethportfolio/src/Component/TopBanner.js",[],{"ruleId":"92","replacedBy":"93"},{"ruleId":"94","replacedBy":"95"},{"ruleId":"96","severity":1,"message":"97","line":41,"column":16,"nodeType":"98","endLine":41,"endColumn":38},{"ruleId":"99","severity":1,"message":"100","line":95,"column":16,"nodeType":"98","endLine":95,"endColumn":91},{"ruleId":"101","severity":1,"message":"102","line":2,"column":10,"nodeType":"103","messageId":"104","endLine":2,"endColumn":20},{"ruleId":"101","severity":1,"message":"102","line":2,"column":10,"nodeType":"103","messageId":"104","endLine":2,"endColumn":20},{"ruleId":"101","severity":1,"message":"102","line":2,"column":10,"nodeType":"103","messageId":"104","endLine":2,"endColumn":20},{"ruleId":"105","severity":1,"message":"106","line":40,"column":14,"nodeType":"98","endLine":40,"endColumn":42},{"ruleId":"101","severity":1,"message":"102","line":2,"column":10,"nodeType":"103","messageId":"104","endLine":2,"endColumn":20},{"ruleId":"107","severity":1,"message":"108","line":7,"column":52,"nodeType":"109","messageId":"110","endLine":7,"endColumn":54},{"ruleId":"107","severity":1,"message":"108","line":8,"column":52,"nodeType":"109","messageId":"110","endLine":8,"endColumn":54},{"ruleId":"105","severity":1,"message":"106","line":18,"column":16,"nodeType":"98","endLine":18,"endColumn":56},{"ruleId":"105","severity":1,"message":"106","line":42,"column":20,"nodeType":"98","endLine":42,"endColumn":42},{"ruleId":"99","severity":1,"message":"100","line":72,"column":18,"nodeType":"98","endLine":76,"endColumn":19},{"ruleId":"105","severity":1,"message":"106","line":78,"column":20,"nodeType":"98","endLine":78,"endColumn":44},{"ruleId":"105","severity":1,"message":"106","line":98,"column":22,"nodeType":"98","endLine":98,"endColumn":43},{"ruleId":"105","severity":1,"message":"106","line":102,"column":22,"nodeType":"98","endLine":102,"endColumn":44},{"ruleId":"105","severity":1,"message":"106","line":106,"column":22,"nodeType":"98","endLine":106,"endColumn":44},{"ruleId":"105","severity":1,"message":"106","line":110,"column":22,"nodeType":"98","endLine":110,"endColumn":44},{"ruleId":"105","severity":1,"message":"106","line":114,"column":22,"nodeType":"98","endLine":114,"endColumn":43},"no-native-reassign",["111"],"no-negated-in-lhs",["112"],"jsx-a11y/anchor-has-content","Anchors must have content and the content must be accessible by a screen reader.","JSXOpeningElement","react/jsx-no-target-blank","Using target=\"_blank\" without rel=\"noreferrer\" is a security risk: see https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/links.html#link-type-noopener","no-unused-vars","'SRLWrapper' is defined but never used.","Identifier","unusedVar","jsx-a11y/alt-text","img elements must have an alt prop, either with meaningful text, or an empty string for decorative images.","eqeqeq","Expected '===' and instead saw '=='.","BinaryExpression","unexpected","no-global-assign","no-unsafe-negation"]

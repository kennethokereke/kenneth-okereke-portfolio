This presented a problem — if our goal is \n                       to find an equitable solution to a health disparity facing our nation, do \n                       we move forward with our research, or go back to the drawing board to find \n                       another problem. To be entirely honest, we were short for time at this point, \n                       so we chose to move forward and research why people from these communities are \n                       less likely to get colorectal cancer screenings.

The entire app was built with javascript using a custom framework called Phosphor.JS.<br /><br />\n                    Widgets and parts of Jupyterlab I worked on: <br />\n                    - Top navigation bar <br />\n                    - Terminal <br />\n                    - Image Viewer <br />\n                    - Redid File Browser <br />\n                    - Notebook widget toolbar <br />\n                  </p>\n               </div>\n               <div className=\"horizGallery\">\n                  {/* <SRLWrapper>\n                     <img src={old} />\n                    <img src={newJ} />\n                    <img src={nbtoolbar} />\n                    <img src={top_nav} />\n                    <img src={files} />\n                    <img src={image} />\n                    <img src={terminal} />\n                 </SRLWrapper> */}\n               </div>\n             </div>\n             <div className=\"section\">\n               <div className=\"sectionContent\">\n                  <h2>Brand Guidelines</h2>\n                  <h4>The Problem</h4>\n                  <p>\n                    The project was suffering from a lack of consistent brand messaging.\n                    Everytime a Jupyter developer needed to create Jupyter branded content they had no clue where to get design assets.\n                    This resulted in dozens of wierd logos for different products, random color choices, and overall unproffesional branding.\n                  </p>\n                  <h4>Our Solution</h4>\n                  <p>\n                    First we created a new version of the logo that consolidated the best parts of all the logos in circulation. Then we created the brand book below that lays out rules for the entire project on how to use the brand and logo in an official and beautiful document. Finally, I went through all our projects assets and fixed violations of these guidelines across all of Jupyter's products.\n                  </p>\n                  {/* <object data={brandGuide}

training, whilst embodying the philosophy of being “a mindful movement.”\n                   They want us to “push past sweaty boundaries”, to build the strength to push \n                   ourselves in other aspects of life.\n                  </p>\n                  <p>\n                  As part of a 2 week sprint, I was tasked with creating a native mobile app for Lululemon,\n                   allowing customers to track health data and book the brand’s in-store events and yoga classes. </p>\n\n                  {/* <h4>My Role</h4> */}\n                  <p>\n                  Together with a team of three other UX designers, we carried out extensive user research\n                   with Lululemon’s target customer base, and found that many were dedicated yogis and \n                   associated the brand with this practice. A key finding was that yoga wasn’t considered \n                   just a physical activity, but a way of life that is best practiced off the mat. \n                   Many were practicing mindfulness and meditation alongside yoga, and saw the two as \n                   running hand in hand.\n\n                  </p>\n                  <p>\n                  We designed Lululemon Mind, a mindfulness app which allows users to customise meditations\n                   based on their mood, and create their own meditation to suit their individual schedule.\n                    (i.e. I would like a 20 minute meditation for my commute) Users highlighted the importance\n                     of establishing a routine with mindfulness to reap the benefits, so we designed a streak\n                      incentive where, if you completed 10 meditations, you would receive a free Lululemon\n                       yoga class. You could book these in-store events and classes on the app.\n                  </p>\n\n                  <p>\n                  Read on for the full case study — or you can view the final <a href=\"https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/EVXCRMJR4GW#/screens\" target=\"_blank\">clickable prototype here!</a>\n                  </p>\n                  <img src={LululemonClient} />\n\n                  <h4>The Brief</h4>\n\n                  <p>\n                  Myself and three other UX designers were tasked with building a native mobile app\n                  for Lululemon, offering customers a way to track their health and book participation\n                  in in-store events\n                  </p>\n\n                  <p><h4>Sprint Length:</h4> 2 weeks </p>\n\n                  <h4>Skills Required</h4>\n                  <ol>\n                    <li>   Business Analysis; Competitive Analysis; </li>\n                    <li> Screener Survey; </li>\n                    <li>User Interviews; </li>\n                    <li> Contextual Inquiry;</li>\n                    <li> Personas; Affinity Mapping; </li>\n                    <li>Experience Mapping; Design Studio;</li>\n                    <li>User Flow and Scenario; </li>\n                    <li> Wireframes and Sketches; </li>\n                    <li>Prototyping and Testing; Visual Design</li>\n                  </ol>\n\n                  <h4>My Role</h4>\n\n                  <p>\n                  Whilst each team member played a role in every step of the process, \n                  I took the lead on the business and competitive analysis, user interviews \n                  ,redesigned the app establishing the visual design \n                  and full style guide.\n                  </p>\n                  <a\n                   id=\"dlButton\"\n                   href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1XJZuMjVv4DdViZdE-ye7nTdZLT1YTYIO6qy0q1ZyRFA/edit?usp=sharing\"\n                   target=\"_blank\"\n                 >\n                   View Research Presentation\n                   <img src={rightArrow} />\n                 </a>\n                 <img src={Lululemoncover} />\n\n                 <h4>Brand Review & Site Visit</h4>\n                 <p>Lululemon is an international athletic apparel company, with their manifesto\n                    centred on creating a community of health, mindfulness and living a life of possibility.\n                     To design an app that was a natural extension of this, we needed to really get under the \n                     skin of the brand.</p>\n\n                     <p>\n                     By visiting three of their stores, including their flagship in Regent Street, \n                     interviewing employees and customers, and exploring their website, a few things were clear:\n                     </p>\n\n                     <ul>\n                       <li><p> Lifestyle brands win big: Lululemon’s strong brand identity is their\n                          selling point and key differentiator in the market.

Two key competitors were Nike and Under Armour — both placing among\n                        the top 15 millennial clothing brands of 2018, with Nike ranking as the \n                        №1 brand for Generation Z.

It’s a saturated market, growing every day, \n                              but it became apparent that there was no sportswear brand that was offering one, \n                              or had gone for more of a lifestyle slant with their app.</p>\n\n                              <img src={LululemonComp} />\n\n                              <h4>Screener Survey and User Interviews</h4>\n                              <p>To understand our potential users and problems that the app could solve,\n                                 we conducted a survey and carried out 16 interviews with people who matched \n                                 the Lulu customer. We asked questions around mindfulness, but also wanted \n                                 to explore their general attitudes and behaviour towards health and fitness.</p>\n\n                                 <p>A key finding from the survey was that 74% out of 65 respondents were\n                                    ‘very conscious’ to ‘extremely conscious’ of their mental wellbeing.</p>\n\n                                    <p>We synthesised our findings into an affinity map, and found three key \n                                      themes across the interviews:</p>\n\n                                      <ul>\n                                        <li>Mindfulness — yes.

People voiced \n                                          concerns over an app created by a sporting retailer, worrying that there would\n                                           be an e-commerce slant to it.

The existing Jupyter Notebooks that all our users knew and loved allowed users to wirte and run code inline in an extremely visual and interactive way. JupyterLab builds around the notebook by adding commonly used developer tools (e.g. a terminal, file browser, text editor, etc.) in a multiwindow interface.<br /><br />\n                    Our team’s job was to research, design, and develop overall interface improvement as well as JupyterLab's builtin plugins. The entire app was built with javascript using a custom framework called Phosphor.JS.<br /><br />\n                    Widgets and parts of Jupyterlab I worked on: <br />\n                    - Top navigation bar <br />\n                    - Terminal <br />\n                    - Image Viewer <br />\n                    - Redid File Browser <br />\n                    - Notebook widget toolbar <br />\n                  </p>\n               </div>\n               <div className=\"horizGallery\">\n                  {/* <SRLWrapper>\n                     <img src={old} />\n                    <img src={newJ} />\n                    <img src={nbtoolbar} />\n                    <img src={top_nav} />\n                    <img src={files} />\n                    <img src={image} />\n                    <img src={terminal} />\n                 </SRLWrapper> */}\n               </div>\n             </div>\n             <div className=\"section\">\n               <div className=\"sectionContent\">\n                  <h2>Brand Guidelines</h2>\n                  <h4>The Problem</h4>\n                  <p>\n                    The project was suffering from a lack of consistent brand messaging.\n                    Everytime a Jupyter developer needed to create Jupyter branded content they had no clue where to get design assets.\n                    This resulted in dozens of wierd logos for different products, random color choices, and overall unproffesional branding.\n                  </p>\n                  <h4>Our Solution</h4>\n                  <p>\n                    First we created a new version of the logo that consolidated the best parts of all the logos in circulation. Then we created the brand book below that lays out rules for the entire project on how to use the brand and logo in an official and beautiful document. Finally, I went through all our projects assets and fixed violations of these guidelines across all of Jupyter's products.\n                  </p>\n                  {/* <object data={brandGuide}

It took me 3-4 days to go through over 350\n                   screenshots and distill down my thoughts into a couple different\n                   findings.

I decided that a{\" \"}\n                   <b>pill-based filtering UI</b>\n                   {\"{\"}\" \"{\"}\"}\n                   would be the way to go.\n                 </p>\n                 <div id=\"proconChart\">\n                   <h4>A pill filtering system would:</h4>\n                   <div>\n                     <p>Find a filter you already have in mind</p>\n                     <img src={mehIcon} />\n                   </div>\n                   <div>\n                     <p>Discover what you should filter by</p>\n                     <img src={goodIcon} />\n                   </div>\n                   <div>\n                     <p>Remove filters you have applied</p>\n                     <img src={goodIcon} />\n                   </div>\n                   <div>\n                     <p>Edit filters you have applied</p>\n                     <img src={goodIcon} />\n                   </div>\n                   <div>\n                     <p>Dont add visual clutter &amp; distract from listings</p>\n                     <img src={badIcon} />\n                   </div>\n                 </div>\n                 {/* Have a design system made  */}\n                 <p>\n                   From there I broke down the pill filtering into specific design parts:\n                   placement, secondary buttons, highlighted filters, bottom overlay\n                   content style, and bottom overlay pill bar style. For each category I\n                   tried to come up with as many options as I could.\n                 </p>\n                 <h4>Step 3: Consolidation and Communication</h4>\n                 <p>\n                   Now I distilled all my wild options, into a few of the best options\n                   for each part of the UI. I tried to compile a list of pros and cons\n                   for each of these options and get really specific with my analysis.\n                   After getting feedback from my team and tweaking my analysis, I again\n                   went around to designers from different stakeholder teams across Johnson & Johnson\n                   to get their opinion on things. This is the point where I made it a\n                   point to get a lot of feedback from the accessibilty team and\n                   developers on feasability and engineering constraints.\n                 </p>\n                 <h4>Step 4: Interaction Design and Visual Details</h4>\n                 <p>\n                   The last step before wrapping my pattern up was to iron out the little\n                   details. With this pattern I really wanted to make sure the iteraction\n                   of opening up the bottom container made sense and felt natural. I also\n                   made it a point to finalize all the colors and icons.\n                 </p>\n               </div>\n             </div>\n             <div className=\"section\"

could use and detailed\n                       documentation on when and how to use this pattern.\n                     </p>\n                   </div>\n                   <div className=\"col\">\n

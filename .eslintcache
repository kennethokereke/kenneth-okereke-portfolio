     <h4>The Project</h4>\n                  <p>\n                    My main job at Jupyter was to help build the next generation JupyterLab web application. The existing Jupyter Notebooks that all our users knew and loved allowed users to wirte and run code inline in an extremely visual and interactive way. JupyterLab builds around the notebook by adding commonly used developer tools (e.g. a terminal, file browser, text editor, etc.) in a multiwindow interface.<br /><br />\n                    Our team’s job was to research, design, and develop overall interface improvement as well as JupyterLab's builtin plugins. The entire app was built with javascript using a custom framework called Phosphor.JS.<br /><br />\n                    Widgets and parts of Jupyterlab I worked on: <br />\n                    - Top navigation bar <br />\n                    - Terminal <br />\n                    - Image Viewer <br />\n                    - Redid File Browser <br />\n                    - Notebook widget toolbar <br />\n                  </p>\n               </div>\n               <div className=\"horizGallery\">\n                  {/* <SRLWrapper>\n                     <img src={old} />\n                    <img src={newJ} />\n                    <img src={nbtoolbar} />\n                    <img src={top_nav} />\n                    <img src={files} />\n                    <img src={image} />\n                    <img src={terminal} />\n                 </SRLWrapper> */}\n               </div>\n             </div>\n             <div className=\"section\">\n               <div className=\"sectionContent\">\n                  <h2>Brand Guidelines</h2>\n                  <h4>The Problem</h4>\n                  <p>\n                    The project was suffering from a lack of consistent brand messaging.\n                    Everytime a Jupyter developer needed to create Jupyter branded content they had no clue where to get design assets.\n                    This resulted in dozens of wierd logos for different products, random color choices, and overall unproffesional branding.\n                  </p>\n                  <h4>Our Solution</h4>\n                  <p>\n                    First we created a new version of the logo that consolidated the best parts of all the logos in circulation. Then we created the brand book below that lays out rules for the entire project on how to use the brand and logo in an official and beautiful document. Finally, I went through all our projects assets and fixed violations of these guidelines across all of Jupyter's products.\n                  </p>\n                  {/* <object data={brandGuide}

A key finding was that yoga wasn’t considered \n                   just a physical activity, but a way of life that is best practiced off the mat. \n                   Many were practicing mindfulness and meditation alongside yoga, and saw the two as \n                   running hand in hand.\n\n                  </p>\n                  <p>\n                  We designed Lululemon Mind, a mindfulness app which allows users to customise meditations\n                   based on their mood, and create their own meditation to suit their individual schedule.\n                    (i.e. I would like a 20 minute meditation for my commute) Users highlighted the importance\n                     of establishing a routine with mindfulness to reap the benefits, so we designed a streak\n                      incentive where, if you completed 10 meditations, you would receive a free Lululemon\n                       yoga class.

Our team was responsible for creating a fully\n                   components-based design system and, in the process, a fresh new design\n                   language.

I needed to create logic and\n                   consistency across all our different pages. After that it was up to me\n                   to decide what to prioritize and what to change.\n                 </p>\n                 <h4>Step 1A: Internal Research</h4>\n                 <div id=\"lightbulbBanner\">\n                   <img src={lightBulb}/>\n                   <p>\n                     For me, understanding the current state of your own product is the\n                     most important step to designing a pattern that scales across every\n                     situation where your pattern may be used.\n                   </p>\n                 </div>\n                 <p>\n                   I spent a little over a week combing through both of Johnson & Johnson mobile\n                   apps and the mobile website, collecting screenshots, and talking to\n                   designers in every design team that I could think of that may get\n                   effected/benefit from my work on the filtering pattern. I came out of\n                   the internal research with 2 goals: <b>increase consistency</b> and\n                   <b>filter usage</b>.\n                 </p>\n                 <h4>Step 1B: External Research</h4>\n                 <p>\n                   The next thing I did was analyze what other companies were doing with\n                   their mobile filtering UIs. My goal here was to understand what\n                   scenarios their filter patterns were used in, which tradeoffs they\n                   made, and why they made those tradeoffs. Basically, I wanted to figure\n                   out every option that I might need to consider in my own designs.\n                   <br />\n                   <br />I gathered screenshots from 20 different company’s mobile apps\n                   and mobile websites and analyzed their filtering mechanisms in browse\n                   pages and search pages. It took me 3-4 days to go through over 350\n                   screenshots and distill down my thoughts into a couple different\n                   findings.

My\n                   goal here is to make sure that I’ve considered every possible option\n                   that makes any sort of sense.\n                   <br />\n                   <br />\n                   First I weighed the pros and cons of every type of filtering UI that I\n                   saw in my external research and tried to understand how they would\n                   affect our 2 main goals. I decided that a{\" \"}\n                   <b>pill-based filtering UI</b>\n                   {\"{\"}\" \"{\"}\"}\n                   would be the way to go.\n                 </p>\n                 <div id=\"proconChart\">\n                   <h4>A pill filtering system would:</h4>\n                   <div>\n                     <p>Find a filter you already have in mind</p>\n                     <img src={mehIcon} />\n                   </div>\n                   <div>\n                     <p>Discover what you should filter by</p>\n                     <img src={goodIcon} />\n                   </div>\n                   <div>\n                     <p>Remove filters you have applied</p>\n                     <img src={goodIcon} />\n                   </div>\n                   <div>\n                     <p>Edit filters you have applied</p>\n                     <img src={goodIcon} />\n                   </div>\n                   <div>\n                     <p>Dont add visual clutter &amp; distract from listings</p>\n                     <img src={badIcon} />\n                   </div>\n                 </div>\n                 {/* Have a design system made  */}\n                 <p>\n                   From there I broke down the pill filtering into specific design parts:\n                   placement, secondary buttons, highlighted filters, bottom overlay\n                   content style, and bottom overlay pill bar style. For each category I\n                   tried to come up with as many options as I could.\n                 </p>\n                 <h4>Step 3: Consolidation and Communication</h4>\n                 <p>\n                   Now I distilled all my wild options, into a few of the best options\n                   for each part of the UI. I tried to compile a list of pros and cons\n                   for each of these options and get really specific with my analysis.\n                   After getting feedback from my team and tweaking my analysis, I again\n                   went around to designers from different stakeholder teams across Johnson & Johnson\n                   to get their opinion on things. This is the point where I made it a\n                   point to get a lot of feedback from the accessibilty team and\n                   developers on feasability and engineering constraints.\n                 </p>\n                 <h4>Step 4: Interaction Design and Visual Details</h4>\n                 <p>\n                   The last step before wrapping my pattern up was to iron out the little\n                   details. With this pattern I really wanted to make sure the iteraction\n                   of opening up the bottom container made sense and felt natural. I also\n                   made it a point to finalize all the colors and icons.\n                 </p>\n               </div>\n             </div>\n             <div className=\"section\"

Final Product</h4>\n                     <p>\n                       At the end of this internship I provided sketch assets for every\n                       part of this pattern that other designers could use and detailed\n                       documentation on when and how to use this pattern.\n                     </p>\n                   </div>\n                   <div className=\"col\">\n
